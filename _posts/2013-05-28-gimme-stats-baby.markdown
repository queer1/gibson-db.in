Just for the record, today i've fixed a [floating point exception](https://github.com/evilsocket/gibson/commit/f0b8ed80831f8844c271ffd9ff4b8bd10061d8bd#L1R100) bug, then i've implemented a new average object size counter and the [STATS](http://gibson-db.in/commands/stats.html) operator to obtain server statistics in realtime.

**note**: did a little bit of website reorganization too, especially for the documentation which is going to be better organized in the near future ^_^
