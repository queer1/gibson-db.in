Yesterday i've performed a little bit of cleaning in the repository, it was a mess with everyhing mixed up.  
Now [gibson](http://github.com/evilsocket/gibson) ( the main server ), [libgibsonclient](http://github.com/evilsocket/libgibsonclient) ( the native client library ) and [phpgibson](http://github.com/evilsocket/phpgibson) ( the PHP5 extension ) have their own repositories.  
The folder structure of the main repository has been cleaned up a little too.
