<div style="float:left; margin-right:10px;">![](/media/logo-105.png)</div> 
A **big thanks** to [Mohammed Alatwi](https://plus.google.com/110512888654148706592) aka [l0sth0pe](https://twitter.com/l0sth0pe) , a really talented designer which made the first version of the official Gibson logo!  
He has already helped me on another occasion, designing the logo for **dSploit** another project of mine ... thanks dude, you are **the man**!
