This was a pretty busy week, i had an interview with a Google recruiter last Thursday so i had to prepare myself, plus i have a full time job which HAS to be my priority.  
But i'm still happy i have reached two big goals in about 2 or 3 days of work. First of all i've finally fixed that f******* ["malformed query" issue #2](https://github.com/evilsocket/gibson/issues/2), then i started to write the first draft version of Gibson protocol specifications.  
Since i came to know that someone is developing a NodeJS client module for Gibson ( details in the next few days ) and he had to reverse its protocol studying the server sources, i've decided to [document the protocol](http://gibson-db.in/protocol.html) even if it's very simple, so if anyone wants to implement a client module for another language ( Python &amp; Ruby would be cool! ) doesn't have to become mad :D
