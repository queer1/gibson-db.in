I'm happy to announce that the official node.js client of Gibson is now stable and released to the public! This was my first node.js experience ( not the first js one though ) and I have to admin I really like this new technology.
The official repo can be found on [github](https://github.com/evilsocket/node-gibson/), a brief documentation follows.

### Connection

Create a Client object to start working.
Host and port can be passed to the constructor with a connection string, both for tcp and unix sockets.

    var gibson = require('./gibson');

    var unix_client = new gibson.Client('unix:///var/run/gibson.sock');
    var tcp_client = new gibson.Client('tcp://127.0.0.1:10128');

The Client object constructor has three more optional parameters, a connection timeout ( default to infinite ), a boolean flag
which specifies if the tcp no delay flag should be used on the socket ( default to true ), and a string with a custom encoding
to be used while decoding data ( default to utf8 ), so the following line:

    var client = new gibson.Client( 'tcp://127.0.0.1:10128', 100, true, 'ascii' );

Will create a client instance bound to a tcp socket, with a 100ms timeout, the tcp no delay flag set and that will use plain 
ascii encoding on incoming data.

### Events

The Client object emits 4 important events - connect, close, timeout and error.

    client.on('connect', function(){
        // no arguments - we've connected
    });

    client.on('close', function(){
        // no arguments - connection has been closed
    });

    client.on('timeout', function(){
        // no arguments - socket timed out
    });

    client.on('error', function(e){
        // there was an error - exception is 1st argument
    });

    // connect to the Gibson server after subscribing to some or all of these events
    client.connect();

### Methods

After connecting, you can start to make requests.

    client.get('key', function(error, result){

        // all of the callbacks have two arguments, the first one will be
        // null if no error occurred, the second one will contain the decoded
        // data ( if any ) received from the server.

    });

    client.set( 3600, 'key', 'value', function(error, result){

        // create ( or replace ) a value with a TTL of 3600 seconds.
        // set the TTL to zero and the value will never expire.

    }, lifetime);

    client.del('key', function(error, result){

        // delete a key from cache.
    });   

    client.stats(function(error, result)){

        // grab the server statistics
    });

Every available command is automatically mapped to a client method, so follow the [official reference](http://gibson-db.in/commands.html) of Gibson commands.

Once you're done, close the connection.

    client.close();
