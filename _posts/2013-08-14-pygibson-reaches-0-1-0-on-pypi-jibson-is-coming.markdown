Thanks to Anton Baklanov for his wonderful work on client modules for Gibson, yesterday I was informed that the first stable version of **pygibson**, his Python client module for Gibson, was published on the **Python Package Index**.

While the Java client, [Jibson](https://github.com/bak1an/jibson), is being developed by Anton these days.
